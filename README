DESCRIPTION
    ngx_http_psgi provides PSGI support for nginx HTTP server

DEMO
        git clone git://github.com/yko/ngx_mod_psgi.git
        cd ngx_mod_psgi
        make
        make demo

    This builds nginx with psgi module and run demo PSGI application
    at address http://127.0.0.1:3000/
    After nginx started, demo sends POST request to server
    and displays output.

    Feel free to replace demo application and/or nginx.conf by your one,
    re-run `make demo` and track down access and error logs
    to see what's happening on server side.

    You also may want to run tests from Plack::Test::Suite:

        make test

PRODUCTION
    This module is not production-ready yet.
    However, if you want to try it in production, feel free to use
    'eg/nginx.conf' as an example. Also make sure you configure your nginx
    with 'add-module' option:

        ./configure [YOUR OPTIONS] --add-module=/path/to/ngx_http_psgi
        make
